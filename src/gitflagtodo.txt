To Do For ”--init-as-git”
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

PROBLEMS!
Right now I have not found a way to solve how can I pass the 2FA-step in the
login process, as I can't get user's input to be forwarded to the browser.
The program otherwise works PERFECTLY, until the 2FA comes in.

QUICK NOTE!
The folder and readme.md etc. need to be created first, when using
--init-as-git as git needs to go to the project folder just created, and
then do the ”init” inside there. So don't accidentally try to init the
folder you're in as that would mess things up!

1. [x] Init dir as git repo.
2. [] Log in to GitHub.
   1. [x] Input your email and password (use sys.argv).
   2. [] Input your Authy token (again, use sys.argv).
3. [] Click ”Create new repository”.
4. [] Enter name for the repository (use the name that was used as a name
   for the project).
5. [] Enter additional description for the project (this can be skipped).
6. [] Select public / private.
7. [] Finally, click ”Create repository”.
